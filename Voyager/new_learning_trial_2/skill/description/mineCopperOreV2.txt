async function mineCopperOre(bot) {
    // The function is about mining one copper ore using a pickaxe. First check if a copper ore is already in the inventory. Next, ensure there is a pickaxe available that can mine copper ore. If a copper ore block is found nearby, mine it directly. Otherwise, explore the environment in a random direction until finding a copper ore block, then mine it. Finally, verify that the copper ore has been successfully collected.
