async function mineCopperOre(bot) {
    // The function is about mining one copper ore using a pickaxe. First check if a copper ore is already in the inventory. If not, ensure a pickaxe is available. Then try to find a copper ore block nearby and mine it. If no copper ore is found nearby, explore in a random direction until one is located and then mine it. Finally, verify that the copper ore has been successfully mined.
