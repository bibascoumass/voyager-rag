async function craftWoodenPickaxe(bot) {
    // The function is about crafting a wooden pickaxe using a crafting table. First check if a wooden pickaxe is already in the inventory. If not, ensure a crafting table is nearby and place one if needed. Then check if there are enough planks and sticks, crafting them from logs if necessary. Finally, craft the wooden pickaxe and verify the result.
