async function mineFiveDiamondOre(bot) {
    // The function is about mining 5 diamond ores using an iron pickaxe. First check if there are already at least 5 diamonds in the inventory. If not, ensure an iron pickaxe is equipped. Then explore the environment to find diamond ore blocks, mining each one until the total reaches 5. If no ore is found nearby, explore in random directions, preferring downwards, to locate more. The process continues until the required number of diamonds is collected.
