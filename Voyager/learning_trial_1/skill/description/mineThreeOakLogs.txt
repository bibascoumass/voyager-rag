async function mineThreeOakLogs(bot) {
    // The function is about mining three oak logs. First check the current number of oak logs in the inventory. If there are already at least three logs, the task is complete. Otherwise, attempt to mine the required number of logs from nearby. If not enough logs are found nearby, explore the environment in a random direction to locate oak logs. Once logs are found during exploration, mine the remaining needed logs. Finally, verify that at least three oak logs have been collected.
