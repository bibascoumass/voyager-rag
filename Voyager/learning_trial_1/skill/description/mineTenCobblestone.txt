async function mineTenCobblestone(bot) {
    // The function is about mining at least 10 cobblestones using a wooden pickaxe. First, it checks if a wooden pickaxe is available and equips it. Then, it checks the current cobblestone count and proceeds only if fewer than 10 are present. Next, it explores the environment to locate stone blocks. Once found, it mines the required number of stone blocks to reach a total of 10 cobblestones, handling any mining errors by attempting to mine individually. Finally, it verifies the cobblestone count to confirm success.
