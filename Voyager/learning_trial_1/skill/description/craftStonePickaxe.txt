async function craftStonePickaxe(bot) {
    // The function is about crafting a stone pickaxe using a crafting table. First check if a stone pickaxe is already in the inventory. If not, ensure a crafting table is placed nearby. Then verify there are at least 2 sticks and 3 cobblestone available, crafting sticks from oak planks or mining cobblestone from stone if needed. Finally, craft the stone pickaxe using the crafting table.
