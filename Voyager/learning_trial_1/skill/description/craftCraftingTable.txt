async function craftCraftingTable(bot) {
    // The function is about crafting a crafting table using oak planks. First check if a crafting table is already in the inventory. If not, check if there are enough oak planks. If there are not enough oak planks, craft them from oak logs. Then, if there are at least four oak planks, craft a crafting table. Finally, verify that the crafting table has been successfully crafted.
