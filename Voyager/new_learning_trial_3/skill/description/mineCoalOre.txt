async function mineCoalOre(bot) {
    // The function is about mining coal ore to obtain at least 5 coal using a pickaxe. First check if a stone or wooden pickaxe is in the inventory, and if not, craft a wooden pickaxe by ensuring necessary materials and a crafting table are available. Equip the pickaxe in hand. Then, if there are already 5 coal, the task is considered complete. Otherwise, search for and mine coal ore blocks until 5 coal are collected, exploring underground if no coal ore is nearby.
