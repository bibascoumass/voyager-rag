Use any axe (wooden, stone, iron, diamond, or netherite) to break the spruce logs, as axes mine wood faster than other tools. Aim for the bottom logs first to make the tree fall more easily.

Ensure you have enough inventory space to hold the logs.", "How to mine 10 stone in Minecraft?": "Answer: To mine 10 stone in Minecraft, you need a pickaxe. First, gather wood by punching trees to get logs, craft them into planks, then create a crafting table. Use planks to make sticks, and combine sticks with planks to craft a wooden pickaxe. Equip the pickaxe and find stone blocks (gray, textured blocks) underground or in caves. Mine at least 10 stone blocks by left-clicking (or holding) on them with the pickaxe. Each block drops cobblestone, which counts as mined stone. If you want smooth stone, smelt the cobblestone in a furnace.", "How to craft 1 furnace in Minecraft?": "Answer: To craft a furnace in Minecraft, you need 8 cobblestone blocks.
