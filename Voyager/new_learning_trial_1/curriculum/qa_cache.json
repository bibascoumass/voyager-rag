For example, a lava bucket smelts 100 items, while coal smelts 8. Avoid less efficient fuels like wood planks unless necessary.\n\n2. **Automation**: Connect hoppers to the furnace\u2014one for input (top) to feed items, one for fuel (side), and one for output (bottom) to collect finished products. This allows continuous smelting without manual intervention.\n\n3. **Bulk Processing**: Smelt in batches to maximize fuel use. For instance, fill the furnace with multiple stacks of ores or food at once to reduce idle time.\n\n4. **Use Smokers/Blast Furnaces**: For food, use a smoker (cooks twice as fast as a furnace). For ores, use a blast furnace (also twice as fast). Both are more fuel-efficient per item due to speed.\n\n5. **Fuel Alternatives**: In early game, use wooden tools or excess wooden items as fuel. Later, set up a bamboo farm (bamboo grows quickly) or a kelp farm (dried kelp blocks are efficient) for renewable fuel.\n\n6. **Enchantments**: Apply the \"Efficiency\" enchantment to hoppers if using automation to speed up item transfer, though this doesn't directly affect the furnace itself.\n\nBy combining these methods, you can optimize speed, fuel consumption, and automation for efficient cooking and smelting.", "What are the common resources found in stone-based biomes like mountains or caves?": "Answer: In stone-based biomes like mountains and caves, common resources include stone, coal ore, iron ore, gold ore, redstone ore, lapis lazuli ore, diamond ore, emerald ore (specifically in mountain biomes), andesite, diorite, granite, and gravel.

Use caves, strip mining, or branch mining to find it. Bring torches, food, and weapons for safety.\n\n2. **Mine Diamond Ore**: You must use an iron pickaxe or better (e.g., diamond or netherite) to mine diamond ore; using a wooden, stone, or gold pickaxe will destroy the ore without dropping diamonds. Each ore block drops one diamond when mined, but Fortune-enchanted pickaxes can increase the yield.\n\n3. **Tips**: Explore deep caves, lava lakes (often near diamonds), or mineshafts. Avoid mining directly above lava to prevent losing diamonds. Use a water bucket to turn lava into obsidian or cobblestone for safer access."}
