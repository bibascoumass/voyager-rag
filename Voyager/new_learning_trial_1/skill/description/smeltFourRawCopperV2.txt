async function smeltFourRawCopper(bot) {
    // The function is about smelting raw copper into copper ingots to obtain at least four ingots. First, it checks the current inventory for copper ingots and raw copper to determine how many raw copper need to be smelted. Next, it verifies that there is sufficient fuel available, such as coal or oak planks and logs, to support the smelting process. If a furnace is not found nearby, it places one in the environment. Then, it proceeds to smelt the required amount of raw copper using the available fuel. Finally, it confirms whether at least four copper ingots have been successfully produced.
