async function craftIronPickaxe(bot) {
    // The function is about crafting an iron pickaxe using a crafting table. First check if an iron pickaxe is already in the inventory. If not, ensure a crafting table is placed nearby. Next, verify there are enough sticks and iron ingots for the recipe. If sticks are insufficient, craft them from oak planks. Then, craft the iron pickaxe using the required materials. Finally, verify the iron pickaxe has been successfully crafted.
