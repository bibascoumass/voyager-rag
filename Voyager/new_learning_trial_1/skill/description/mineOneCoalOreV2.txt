async function mineOneCoalOre(bot) {
    // The function is about mining one coal ore block. First, it checks if a coal ore block is nearby. If found, it mines the coal ore block. If not, it explores in a random direction to find a coal ore block. Once a coal ore block is found during exploration, it mines the coal ore block. If no coal ore block is found within the exploration time, it reports failure.
