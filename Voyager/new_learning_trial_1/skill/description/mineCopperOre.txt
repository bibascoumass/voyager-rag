async function mineCopperOre(bot) {
    // The function is about mining one copper ore using a stone or better pickaxe. First check if raw copper is already in the inventory. If not, ensure a suitable pickaxe is available and equip it. Then search for a copper ore block nearby. If none is found, explore the environment in a random direction until one is located. Finally, mine the copper ore block to obtain raw copper.
