async function mineFourCobblestone(bot) {
    // The function is about mining 4 cobblestones using any available pickaxe. First check if at least 4 cobblestones are already in the inventory. If not, ensure a pickaxe is available. Then explore the environment until finding enough stone blocks. Once found, mine a total of 4 cobblestone blocks. Finally, verify the inventory to confirm the cobblestone count.
