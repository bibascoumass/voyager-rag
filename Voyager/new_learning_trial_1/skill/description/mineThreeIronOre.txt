async function mineThreeIronOre(bot) {
    // The function is about mining 3 iron ore blocks using a stone pickaxe or better. First check if there are already at least 3 raw iron in the inventory. If not, ensure a suitable pickaxe is available and equip it. Then explore the environment until at least 3 iron ore blocks are found. Once found, mine exactly 3 iron ore blocks. Finally, verify the inventory contains at least 3 raw iron after mining.
