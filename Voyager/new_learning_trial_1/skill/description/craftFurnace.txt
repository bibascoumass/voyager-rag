    // The function is about crafting a furnace using cobblestone. First check if a furnace is already in the inventory. If not, ensure there are at least 8 cobblestones by mining more stone if needed. Then place a crafting table nearby if one is not already present. Finally, craft a furnace using the cobblestone on the crafting table.
